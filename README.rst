econpizza - numba_legacy
========================

Contains tools to simulate nonlinear perfect foresight models. The baseline mechanism is a Fair-Taylor-like stacking method similar to the nonlinear solver in dynare.

This is the last version that builds on `numba` instead of `jax` and is kept for legacy reasons

There is some documentation in the `/docs` folder.
